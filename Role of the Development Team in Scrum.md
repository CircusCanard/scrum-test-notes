**The Development Team** in Scrum is responsible for delivering a potentially releasable increment of the product at the end of each sprint. The team is self-organizing, cross-functional, and collectively accountable for the work done. They possess all the skills necessary to create the product increment without relying on external help.

Scrum Events and the Development Team’s Role

##### 1. Sprint

**Role**: The Development Team works on the tasks defined in the Sprint Backlog to achieve the sprint goal.
**Participation**:
Throughout the Sprint: The team collaborates, self-organizes, and works on completing the tasks. They adapt their plan as necessary and ensure the work meets the definition of "Done."

##### 2. Sprint Planning

**Role**: The Development Team collaborates with the Product Owner to plan the work to be done during the sprint.
**Participation**:
Before the Meeting: The team reviews the Product Backlog items and prepares any questions for the Product Owner.
During the Meeting: The team selects the items from the Product Backlog that they will work on, defines the sprint goal, and breaks the selected items into tasks. They estimate the effort required and commit to the sprint plan.

#### 3. Daily Scrum

**Role**: The Development Team holds the Daily Scrum to inspect their progress towards the sprint goal and plan the next 24 hours.
**Participation**:
During the Meeting: Each team member answers three questions:
What did I do yesterday to help the Development Team meet the sprint goal?
What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the sprint goal?
Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the sprint goal?
The team adjusts their plan based on the discussions.

#### 4. Sprint Review

**Role**: The Development Team demonstrates the work done during the sprint to the Product Owner and stakeholders.
**Participation**:
Before the Meeting: The team ensures the increment is complete and meets the definition of "Done."
During the Meeting: The team presents the increment, answers questions, and gathers feedback from stakeholders. They collaborate with the Product Owner to update the Product Backlog based on the feedback. 5. Sprint Retrospective
**Role**: The Development Team participates in the Sprint Retrospective to reflect on their performance and identify areas for improvement.
**Participation**:
During the Meeting: The team discusses what went well, what didn’t, and how they can improve. They identify actionable items for the next sprint and commit to making improvements.

#### Conclusion

The Development Team is central to the success of Scrum. Their responsibilities encompass delivering high-quality product increments, self-organizing to manage their work, and continuously improving their processes. By actively participating in all Scrum events, the Development Team ensures that they are aligned with the sprint goals, responsive to changes, and committed to delivering value. Their collaboration with the Product Owner and adherence to Scrum practices are crucial for achieving successful project outcomes.
